# Coursera - Machine learning assignments

This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. 
After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. 
Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code as a reference.

**Note:**

The code of the exercises passed all the test cases and got the maximum grade when I created it (in 2018). 

I am not sure that if the assignments now have been updated and you may need to modify the code a little bit to make it works.

Cheer!!! :D

## Programming language

The code is written in **Matlab** language.
